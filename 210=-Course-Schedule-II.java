Intuition

This approach is much easier to think about intuitively as will be clear from the following point/fact about topological ordering.

The first node in the topological ordering will be the node that doesn't have any incoming edges. Essentially, any node that has an in-degree of 0 can start the topologically sorted order. If there are multiple such nodes, their relative order doesn't matter and they can appear in any order.
Our current algorithm is based on this idea. We first process all the nodes/course with 0 in-degree implying no prerequisite courses required. If we remove all these courses from the graph, along with their outgoing edges, we can find out the courses/nodes that should be processed next. These would again be the nodes with 0 in-degree. We can continuously do this until all the courses have been accounted for.

Algorithm

Initialize a queue, Q to keep a track of all the nodes in the graph with 0 in-degree.
Iterate over all the edges in the input and create an adjacency list and also a map of node v/s in-degree.
Add all the nodes with 0 in-degree to Q.
The following steps are to be done until the Q becomes empty.
Pop a node from the Q. Let's call this node, N.
For all the neighbors of this node, N, reduce their in-degree by 1. If any of the nodes' in-degree reaches 0, add it to the Q.
Add the node N to the list maintaining topologically sorted order.
Continue from step 4.1.
